# ni2-electrophys

This repository contains the MATLAB exercises that are part of the source reconstruction section of the [Neuroimaging II: Electrophysiological Methods](https://www.ru.nl/courseguides/socsci/courses-osiris/cns/sow-dgcn39-neuroimaging-ii-electrophysiological/) course in the [Cognitive Neuroscience](https://www.ru.nl/courseguides/socsci/research-master/cognitive-neuroscience/) research masters.

Each of the classes consists of a combination of a lecture, some reading material, and most of the time also of some MATLAB exercises that allow you to further familiarize yourself with the most important concepts.

These exercises deal with the biophysics of forward and inverse modeling of the sources of EEG and MEG, and cover the following topics:

-   Forward modeling: going from sources to sensors
-   Inverse modeling: going from sensors to sources

The part on inverse modeling is further split over these three:

-   Parametric models (dipole fitting)
-   Distributed models (linear modeling)
-   Scanning methods (beamformers)

## Frequently asked questions

### MATLAB complains that mexmaci64 cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified

This happens on recent macOS computers, see [this page](https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/faq/mexmaci64_cannot_be_opened_because_the_developer_cannot_be_verified/) to solve it.
